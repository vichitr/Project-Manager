  <p>
    Student Teacher Project Manager solves the problem of managing course mini projects and even more. Teachers just need to
	update the information on the web and students need to do everything online.
	In this application, users can sign up as a student or a teacher or a reviewer. Teachers can add courses and students can submit projects
    based on their interests. Reviewer account is for teacher assistants who review the projects submitted by students.
